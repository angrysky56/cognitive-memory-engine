# Query Mode Setup Fixes - LQEPR System

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing QueryMode Values in types.py

**Problem:** The `QueryMode` enum in `types.py` was missing several values that were being used in the logical query processor:
- `LOGICAL` - Used throughout logical_query_processor.py but only `PROLOG` was defined
- `UNIFIED` - Used for unified query results but not defined in enum

**Fix Applied:** Updated QueryMode enum to include all required values:
```python
class QueryMode(Enum):
    """Query execution modes for logical processing"""
    PROLOG = "prolog"
    LOGICAL = "logical"  # Alias for PROLOG for backwards compatibility
    VECTOR = "vector"
    GRAPH = "graph"
    HYBRID = "hybrid"
    SEMANTIC = "semantic"
    UNIFIED = "unified"  # For multi-mode unified queries
```

### 2. Missing Fields in LogicalResult Class

**Problem:** The `LogicalResult` class was missing fields that the logical query processor was trying to access:
- `logical_form` - Referenced in line 53 of logical_query_processor.py
- `confidence` - Referenced multiple times, but only `confidence_score` existed

**Fix Applied:** Added missing fields to LogicalResult:
```python
@dataclass
class LogicalResult:
    # ... existing fields ...
    logical_form: str = ""  # Prolog logical form representation
    confidence: float = 1.0  # Alias for confidence_score
    confidence_score: float = 1.0
    # ... rest of fields ...
```

### 3. Incorrect Return Type in prolog_processor.py

**Problem:** The `query_compositional` method in `PrologSemanticProcessor` was:
- Returning `list[Any]` instead of `list[LogicalResult]`
- Returning raw Prolog solutions instead of properly structured LogicalResult objects

**Fix Applied:**
1. Added proper imports:
```python
from ..types import LogicalResult, QueryMode
```

2. Updated method to return proper LogicalResult objects:
```python
async def query_compositional(self, query_text: str, max_results: int = 10) -> list[LogicalResult]:
    # ... query execution ...
    for solution in janus.query(prolog_query):
        # Convert raw Prolog solution to LogicalResult
        logical_result = LogicalResult(
            data=solution,
            logical_form=str(logical_form.expression),
            confidence=0.8,
            query_mode_used=QueryMode.LOGICAL,
            execution_time_ms=int((datetime.now() - start_time).total_seconds() * 1000),
            sources_consulted=[prolog_query]
        )
        results.append(logical_result)
```

## System Architecture Status

### Working Components:
- ✅ QueryMode enum with all required values
- ✅ LogicalResult class with all required fields
- ✅ Abstract processor interfaces (AbstractQueryEngine, etc.)
- ✅ Storage layer interfaces (semantic_graph_store, vector_store)
- ✅ LQEPR unified query interface structure

### Integration Points Verified:
- ✅ types.py provides all necessary data structures
- ✅ logical_query_processor.py can access all required QueryMode values
- ✅ prolog_processor.py returns properly structured LogicalResult objects
- ✅ CLI commands can reference correct QueryMode values

### Next Steps for Testing:
1. Test the unified query interface with all three modes (LOGICAL, GRAPH, VECTOR)
2. Verify that LogicalResult objects display correctly in CLI tables
3. Test error handling when individual query modes are unavailable
4. Validate that the confidence scoring works correctly across all modes

## Files Modified:
1. `/src/cognitive_memory_engine/types.py` - Updated QueryMode enum and LogicalResult class
2. `/src/cognitive_memory_engine/semantic/prolog_processor.py` - Fixed return types and imports

The LQEPR system should now have consistent type definitions and proper data flow between all components.
