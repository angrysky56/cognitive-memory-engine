COGNITIVE MEMORY ENGINE - PROLOG DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION
Complete Solution Plan & Implementation Guide

STATUS: The core CME system is working excellently. Issues are specifically 
with Prolog integration that breaks system and creates installation barriers.

=============================================================================
PROBLEM ANALYSIS
=============================================================================

WHAT'S WORKING:
✅ Core conversation memory (RTM trees, temporal organization)
✅ Document knowledge storage (hierarchical concepts, salience scoring)
✅ Blended queries (conversation + formal knowledge integration)
✅ Vector storage and retrieval (ChromaDB integration)
✅ Background processing (async task handling)
✅ MCP server functionality

IDENTIFIED ISSUES:
❌ Hard dependency on janus_swi without graceful fallback
❌ 11 NotImplementedError methods in logical_query_processor.py  
❌ 5 breaking issues in prolog_processor.py
❌ Hardcoded SWI-Prolog paths making system non-portable
❌ Complex multi-system integration that fails when any part missing
❌ User installation difficulties with SWI-Prolog requirement

=============================================================================
SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE
=============================================================================

DESIGN PRINCIPLE: Graceful Degradation
- Core CME functionality MUST work without any optional dependencies
- Advanced features available when dependencies installed
- Zero breaking changes for existing functionality
- Semantic fallbacks for all logical operations

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
1. Make Prolog completely optional with safe import handling
2. Implement semantic analysis fallbacks for all logical operations  
3. Provide complete functionality whether Prolog available or not
4. Maintain compatibility with existing CME architecture

=============================================================================
FILES CREATED - IMPROVED IMPLEMENTATIONS
=============================================================================

1. logical_query_processor_improved.py
   - Optional Prolog dependency with graceful fallback
   - Complete implementation of all NotImplementedError methods
   - Semantic similarity fallbacks for logical relevance scoring
   - Robust multi-system integration with graceful degradation
   - Rich display support with fallbacks

2. prolog_processor_improved.py  
   - Safe import of janus_swi with comprehensive fallback
   - Semantic analysis alternatives for formal logic operations
   - Dual-mode operation (Prolog when available, semantic always)
   - Enhanced error handling and monitoring
   - Zero breaking changes for existing code

=============================================================================
SOLUTION FEATURES
=============================================================================

GRACEFUL DEGRADATION:
- System automatically detects Prolog availability
- Seamlessly switches between formal logic and semantic fallbacks
- Maintains full functionality in both modes
- Clear status indicators for degraded mode

SEMANTIC FALLBACKS:
- Term overlap analysis for logical relevance scoring
- Pattern matching for compositional semantics
- Structured data storage for knowledge base facts
- Relationship extraction using text analysis

ENHANCED ERROR HANDLING:
- Comprehensive try/catch blocks with logging
- Automatic fallback activation on Prolog failures
- Detailed system health monitoring and diagnostics
- Performance tracking for both modes

USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Works immediately without any Prolog installation
- Optional enhancement when Prolog installed
- Clear system status and capability reporting
- Helpful recommendations for system improvement
