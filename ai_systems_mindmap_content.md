# AI Systems: Capabilities, Infrastructure, Impact

## Core AI Systems

### AI-Assisted Communication
- Conceptual Framework (Integrated Tried)
- AI Cognitive Flexibility & Insight
- Autonomous AI Coding Pipelines
- Lotka-Volterra Selection for AI Outputs

### AI Infrastructure & Development
- Advanced Prompting Techniques
- AI Societal Impact & Ethics
- AI Architectural Design

### Design Principles for Enhanced AI
- Debasing Techniques
- AI Alignment Evolution

## Knowledge Representation Systems

### Alternative Knowledge Representations
- 'Rosetta Stone' Learning
- Self-Reflection/Metacognition
- Flexi-blends Knowledge Representations
- Learning from Analogous Data ('Rosetta Stone')
- Robust Metacognitive Capabilities
- Synergistic Interactions
- Promotes robustness (avoids 'shadow of knowledge')
- Less tethered to training instance idiosyncrasies
- Active quality control (addresses inconsistencies/biases)

### Representational Pluralism
- Embrace Representational Pluralism
- Prioritize Learning Abstract Invariants
- Embed Metacognitive Loops
- Foster Grounding and Contextual Awareness
- Design for 'Wicked' Environments
- Cultivate Epistemic Humility

## Specific Implementations

### LV Framework Features
- LLMs can correct errors if location known
- Metacognition Paradox (resource conflict)
- Crucial for robustness, explainability, safety
- Path to 'Wise AI'

### Methods
- Identify errors/inconsistencies
- Adaptively refine models/strategies
- CoT Analysis & Critique
- Backtracking from Known Errors
- Iterative Self-Training (Agent-R)
- Internalized Self-Correction (InSeC)
- Multiplex CoT (Double CoT)
- Metacognitive Architectures
- Programmatic Error Injection
- Domain-Specific Self-Correction Datasets
