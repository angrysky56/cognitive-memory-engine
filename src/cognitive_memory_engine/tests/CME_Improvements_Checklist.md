# CME Improvements Checklist âœ…

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Cross-Reference Persistence âœ…
- [x] Created `CrossReferenceStore` class
- [x] Persistent storage in JSON format  
- [x] Bidirectional indexing
- [x] Added to engine initialization
- [x] Added to cleanup method
- [x] Exported from storage module

### 2. Semantic Similarity Scoring âœ…
- [x] Created `SemanticSimilarityCalculator` class
- [x] Integrated into `link_conversation_to_knowledge()`
- [x] Integrated into `query_blended_knowledge()`
- [x] Fallback to word overlap on error

- [x] Returns links with statistics
- [x] Handles cross-reference store initialization
- [x] Removed "not_implemented" placeholder

### 5. Code Cleanup âœ…
- [x] Updated outdated TODO comments
- [x] Fixed DocumentStore initialization

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all improvements:
```bash
cd /home/ty/Repositories/ai_workspace/cognitive-memory-engine
python test_cme_improvements.py
```

## Next Steps

The CME is now fully enhanced with:
- Semantic understanding for better matching
- Persistent cross-references between knowledge tracks
- Improved retrieval and scoring mechanisms

All requested improvements have been successfully implemented! ðŸŽ‰
