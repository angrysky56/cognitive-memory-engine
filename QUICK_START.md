- **Privacy Preserving**: All data stays local
- **Cost Effective**: No API costs after setup
- **High Performance**: Sub-second response times

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration
```python
from cognitive_memory_engine import CognitiveMemoryEngine

cme = CognitiveMemoryEngine(
    data_dir="./my_memory",
    ollama_model="llama3:8b",           # Different model
    embedding_model="all-mpnet-base-v2" # Better embeddings
)
```

### Querying with Specific Temporal Scope
```python
from cognitive_memory_engine import MemoryQuery

query = MemoryQuery(
    query="What did we discuss about AI memory?",
    max_context_depth=5,      # Deeper RTM traversal
    temporal_scope="week",    # Week-level memories
    include_social_context=True
)

response = await cme.query_memory(query)
```

### Memory Analytics
```python
# Get detailed statistics
stats = await cme.get_memory_stats()
print(f"RTM Trees: {stats['rtm_trees']['total_trees']}")
print(f"Compression: {stats['rtm_trees']['avg_compression_ratio']:.1f}x")

# Export memory graph for analysis
graph_file = await cme.export_memory_graph(format="gml")
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python test_imports.py
   ```

2. **Ollama Not Found**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
   ollama serve  # Run in background
   ollama pull qwen2.5:7b
   ```

3. **ChromaDB Issues**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade chromadb
   rm -rf ./demo_data/vectors/chroma_db  # Reset if corrupted
   ```

4. **Memory Errors**
   ```bash
   # Use smaller model if running out of memory
   ollama pull qwen2.5:3b
   # Update model in code: ollama_model="qwen2.5:3b"
   ```
